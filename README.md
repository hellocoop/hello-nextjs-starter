# Hellō Next.js Sample

This is a sample application for the Hellō Next.js SDK [@hellocoop/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellocoop/nextjs)

You can have this app running fully configured on localhost in a minute, and then deploy to Vercel fully configured a minute later.

1. [Fork and clone this repository to your GitHub account](#1-fork-and-clone-this-repository-to-your-github-account)
2. [ Install, configure, and run!](#2-install-configure-and-run)
3. [Check in updates & deploy to Vercel](#3-check-in-updates--deploy-to-vercel)
   
See a deployed version  at [https://hello-nextjs-sample.vercel.app](https://hello-nextjs-sample.vercel.app) 

> If you want to add Hellō to your own Next.js app, we have a [Quickstart](https://www.hello.dev/docs/quickstarts/nextjs/) for that!

Here is a video that forks, clones, installs, configures, runs locally and then deploys to Vercel:

To run locally, you will need:

- [nodejs 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account

## 1\. Fork and clone this repository to your GitHub account

<https://github.com/hellocoop/hello-nextjs-sample/fork>

[How to clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

You should now have a `hello-nextjs-sample` directory on your machine with the contents of this repo.

## 2\. Install, configure, and run!

Run these commands to start running locally:

```sh
cd hello-nextjs-sample
npm install
npm run quickstart
```
You should see a prompt to hit ENTER to open the browser.  Once the browser is open, follow the steps to update your local environment with the necessary configuration. It should look something like:

Once completed, you will now have the necessary configuration and environment variables. Continue by running the following: 

```
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> (assuming port 3000 was free)

Click the `[ ō Continue with Hellō ]` button to login. You will be sent to the Hellō Wallet. As you have not added a logo or urls, you will see placeholders.

## 3\. Check in updates & deploy to Vercel

You will need:

- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account *linked to your GitHub account* so it can access the repo you just created
- Vercel CLI that is logged into your Vercel account 

The following commands will install the Vercel CLI and login

```sh
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
```

The following commands will:
- check in the Quickstart updates to your repo
- link this project to your Vercel account
- set HELLO_COOKIE_SECRET values in Vercel
- deploy this sample to Vercel
- load the deployed site

```sh
git commit -a -m"quickstart"
git push origin
vercel link --yes
npm run config:vercel
```
For Windows systems, run:
```
For /f %i in ('vercel --yes') do set "DEPLOYMENT=%i"
npx open-cli %DEPLOYMENT%
```

otherwise, run:
```
DEPLOYMENT=$(vercel --yes)
npx open-cli $DEPLOYMENT
```

> We have had a report that `vercel link --yes` may fail. We have not been able to replicate. If it fails, please run `vercel link --yes --debug`. You can likely work around it with `vercel link` and accept all defaults.

No other configuration needed at Vercel!

To delete the Vercel deployment:
```sh
vercel remove hello-nextjs-sample --yes
```

# How Configuration Works

The Hellō Quickstart Web App;
- created your application at Hellō, returned your `client_id`, and added it to the `hello.config.ts` file
- generated a random `HELLO_COOKIE_SECRET` and wrote it to `env.local`

You are able to use your app on your own machine immediately as `http://localhost:*` Redirect URIs are enabled for your development team by default.

The `npm run config:vercel` generates new `HELLO_COOKIE_SECRET` values and sets them in the Vercel `production`, `preview`, and `development` environments. 

After deploying the app to Vercel, you are able to access your app when deployed as we have enabled `https://*` Redirect URIs for members of your development team. The first time you login to your deployed app, the [@hellocoop/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellocoop/nextjs) package auto configures the `redirect_uri`, and on return you will be prompted to add the Redirect URI to your app at the [Hello Developer Console](https://console.hello.coop/). For `preview` deployments you only want your team to access, add to your Development Redirect URIs, for production or deployments you want others to access, add to your Production Redirect URIs.
